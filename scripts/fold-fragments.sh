# Folds one-line fragments into CHANGELOG.md and docs/PROGRESS.md, then deletes them.
#
# A PR never appends to CHANGELOG.md or the Done list of docs/PROGRESS.md: two PRs that both
# append a line there conflict, and every merge of main costs a re-review. Instead a PR adds a
# new file, named after its branch with "/" as "-" (claude/foo -> claude-foo.md):
#   changelog.d/<name>.md       one line "- <entry>", for "## Unreleased" in CHANGELOG.md
#   docs/progress.d/<name>.md   one line "- <date> · <task> · <what> · <PR>", for "## Done"
# Fold on main before a release (a docs PR that runs this script), so the release PR then
# moves the entries from "## Unreleased" under the new version.
#
# Rules, all checked before anything is written (it writes both files or neither):
# - a fragment is a regular file directly in its directory, named [A-Za-z0-9._-]+.md, exactly
#   one line "- <text>" (LF only, a final newline is optional); README.md is not a fragment and
#   must start with a "# " heading; any other entry in the directory (a subdirectory, a .txt
#   file, a link, a name with a space, tab or newline) is an error, never skipped;
# - the target file exists and has its heading exactly once;
# - no target, fragment directory or fragment is a symlink, or lies under one.
# Deterministic: fragments fold in byte order of their file names (LC_ALL=C), at the end of
# their section, with one blank line before the next heading. Without fragments it changes
# nothing.
#
# Usage: fold-fragments.sh [repo root; default: the git top level, else .]
