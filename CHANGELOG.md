# Changelog

All notable changes to bosun. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
bosun is unreleased, so every entry is under Unreleased.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `risk-check` accepts an owner's PR comment `/bosun approve <head sha>` (full 40-character SHA,
  unedited) as the approval of a high-risk PR, beside a GitHub review. The `risk` workflow also
  runs on such comments, from the default branch.
- Kill switch: an open issue labelled `bosun:halt` and opened by an owner halts bosun (exit 4).
  Create the label with `gh label create bosun:halt --repo <owner>/<repo> --color B60205`.

### Changed

- The `risk` workflow runs on `pull_request_target` instead of `pull_request`: the judging job
  comes from the base branch, never checks out PR-head code, passes event data through `env`
  only, and has least permissions. `tests/workflows.rs` asserts it.
- The repo variable `BOSUN_HALT` is now a second, optional kill-switch source: 404 (unset) and 403
  (not readable from this token) are no signal; any other read error still halts. Before, a 403
  halted every session behind the agent proxy.
- `bosun doctor` step 5 ("kill switch") checks the `bosun:halt` label instead of the variable.
